    <p class="lead ">
      The Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI) was founded in August 2017,
      with a vision to expand and further the research, education and outreach activities of the erstwhile 
      Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Data Science at IIT Madras.
     </p> 
     <p class="lead">
      RBC-DSAI comprises faculty from several departments
      across the Institute, who carry out research in various areas of data science and artificial intelligence. The long-term
      vision of RBC-DSAI is to become a world leader in data science research, where long-standing fundamental research problems,
      cutting across disciplines, are targeted and solved.
